# Microstructure-prediction-cGAN

This repository contains the code for our publication "Mastering processing-microstructure complexity through the prediction of thin film structure zone diagrams by generative machine learning models" [arxiv 1910.09468](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09468).
It contains a Jupyter Notebook for a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that is trained on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) surface microstructure images. Model weights for the cGAN generator are provided. The image data set is available through ...
Addtional models are a CNN classifier for microstructure classification and a variational autoencoder (VAE).
