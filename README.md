# Microstructure-prediction-cGAN

This repository contains the code for the publication "Mastering processing-microstructure complexity through the prediction of thin film structure zone diagrams by generative machine learning models" [arxiv 1910.09468](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09468).
It contains a Jupyter Notebook for a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that is trained on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) surface microstructure images. The folder Image descriptor files contains process parameters and chemical composition of each Cr-Al-O-N SEM surface image. Process parameters and chemical composition are the conditional parameters for the cGAN. Addtional models are a CNN classifier for microstructure classification and a variational autoencoder (VAE). Model weights for the cGAN generator and the microstructure classifier CNN are provided. The image data set is available through [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LEPSJW).
